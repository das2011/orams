Hi {{contact_name}},

Thanks for updating your profile and accepting the new Master Agreement.

The changes are now being reviewed before being published on the seller catalogue. Weâ€™ll send you an email to let you know when the changes are live.

If you've added new services we recommend reading our [seller guide]({{url_sellers_guide}}). It explains the assessment process for each new service and why you need to express interest as early as possible.

Thanks being part of the Digital Marketplace.

The Marketplace team
