Hi {{contact_name}},

Your application to join the Digital Marketplace has now been received. 

Weâ€™ll send you an email to let you know the outcome of the initial assessment soon.

**In the meantime**

We recommend reading our [seller guide]({{url_sellers_guide}}).

It explains:

1. Why you need to express interest in opportunities early
2. The assessment process
3. How to offer new products or services

Looking forward to seeing you in the Marketplace.

The Marketplace team

**Your feedback shapes the Marketplace**

The Digital Marketplace is an agile development in Beta. This means it will evolve over time in response to user needs. If you have any questions, feedback or would like to help shape the service by being involved in user research, email [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).
