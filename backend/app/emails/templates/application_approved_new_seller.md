Congratulations,

{{business_name}} has been added to the Digital Marketplace [seller catalogue]({{url_seller_page}}). 

This means buyers from local, state and federal government can contact you and learn more about your business.

You’re also on our mailing list for new opportunities published by government buyers.

If you see something you like, make sure you express your interest in the opportunity early — **at least 3 business days before the opportunity closes**.

This is important because you may need to be assessed before you can apply for the opportunity. To learn more about assessments see our [seller guide]({{url_sellers_guide}}).

Thanks for being part of the Digital Marketplace.

The Marketplace team 

**Where to next?**
